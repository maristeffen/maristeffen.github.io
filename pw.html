          Facebook
Product Designer | March 2022 - April 2023

I was one of two designers tasked with designing and launching the MVP for Facebook audio channels, which are virtual meeting spaces for Facebook group members to talk about shared interests.

During the ideation phase of the project, I conducted an end-to-end audit of Rooms, Facebook’s existing group calling feature, to better understand how to:

achieve parity across mobile and web
align the new audio channels creation with the existing Room creation flow
reduce friction for admins when creating audio channels for the first time
Discovery
I organized a cross-functional brainstorm across the team to gain new perspectives on how we might convey audio channels. Eight people joined across various different roles, and we had a great conversation about focusing on our users’ needs and and realization that we needed to convey group audio channels as a space to connect people through shared interests.


I put these ideas together in a request for an illustration, and after cycles of feedback and iterations, the visual design team created this image that successfully conveys the possibilities of audio channels as a virtual space for anything from talking about shared interests to planning social activities in real life.


Wireframes
Through several iterations of sketching, wireframing, and collaborating with engineers, the following pieces came into place. Many factors were taken into consideration, from how to translate the list of participants to a larger screen, to navigating design constraints across multiple levels of cross-team collaboration.



Launch & Feedback
Following our public launch in July across both Facebook and Messenger, audio channels received positive feedback from admins of large Facebook groups. Our team worked on building out features to enable scheduling, sharing, and increase discoverability.
