<h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
<p>Playlist is a native iOS app design that enables users to rate musical genres for better listening suggestions. It also aims to simplify the selection process by minimizing the number of clicks it takes to play all songs in an album or customized playlist.</p>

<h3>LOW-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</h3>
<p>When considering the navigation and menu for this project, I did a comparative analysis of the top two music players for iOS: Apple Music and Spotify. I personally preferred the simplicity of a music player that focuses on organizing the music on your device. I wanted to make it easy to create a playlist and share it. I also wanted the organization to be very clear and simple.
Music recommendations with cloud-based music tend to be very broad, and don’t enable users to specify their music tastes. For that reason, I wanted to give users a screen to select their favorite musical genres, so that they can decide which music genres they want to hear often and which ones they never want to hear. These questions will load when they open the app for the first time, and will also be accessible through their user profile.</p>

  <h3>HIGH-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</h3>
<p>As I continued to prototype my designs in Marvel, I conducted user tests and refined the layout and elements until I achieved a version that enabled users to successfully complete the user flows that I had mapped out.
The design follows iOS style guides, including rounded corners on text fields and buttons and a bottom navi- gation bar with icons in a cohesive style.
I originally planned to use a standard map, but decided to include a hand-drawn outline of Seattle to make it appeal to casual beer explorers and tourists. After I designed the map, I changed my original yellow color scheme to blues and greens, which allowed for better color contrast to adhere to accessibility guidelines. Although my color scheme deviates from the yellows-oranges-browns typically associated with beer, the blues and greens reflect Seattle's sports teams, along with a light blue background that pairs well with both colors.
During my next iteration, I plan to improve on the search filter design so that they are more intuitive and aligned with iOS and Android standards.</p></div>
