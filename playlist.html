      Check into local breweries to earn badges and goods.

<h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
<p>Seattle Beer Trail is a native app that enables users to search, filter, and sort breweries within the city. It’s designed for not only craft beer enthusiasts, but to appeal to the casual beer explorer and Seattle tourist as well.</p>
<p>Despite being a hotspot for craft breweries, Seattle doesn’t have a city-wide beer trail. Many cities and counties have developed digital or in-person maps where users can check in to breweries and collect items as a reward.</p>

<h3>LOW-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</h3>
<p>I began the design process with low-fidelity wireframes in Sketch. The low-fidelity wireframes allowed me to refine the design and brainstorm solutions for the user flows.
I wanted to include icons for a visual representation of what each breweries offer (i.e. allows kids, allows dogs, offers growler fills, gluten free, etc.) but I ultimately de- cided to use word tags in the high-fidelity screen so that I could focus on the badge designs instead.
I used these wireframes in a prototype, which allowed me to see screens that were missing. I added screens and buttons to enable to complete the user flows that I had mapped in the first step.</p>

  <h3>HIGH-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</h3>
<p>As I continued to prototype my designs in Marvel, I conducted user tests and refined the layout and elements until I achieved a version that enabled users to successfully complete the user flows that I had mapped out.
The design follows iOS style guides, including rounded corners on text fields and buttons and a bottom navi- gation bar with icons in a cohesive style.
I originally planned to use a standard map, but decided to include a hand-drawn outline of Seattle to make it appeal to casual beer explorers and tourists. After I designed the map, I changed my original yellow color scheme to blues and greens, which allowed for better color contrast to adhere to accessibility guidelines. Although my color scheme deviates from the yellows-oranges-browns typically associated with beer, the blues and greens reflect Seattle's sports teams, along with a light blue background that pairs well with both colors.
During my next iteration, I plan to improve on the search filter design so that they are more intuitive and aligned with iOS and Android standards.</p></div>
